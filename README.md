# Dog Viewer

## Project Requirements

### Part 1: General display

The app should display a random dog image on the top, labeled by its breed. Below that, the app should show
the thumbnails and breeds of 10 random dogs.
When the user clicks on a thumbnail, that image should be shown as the main image.
When the user hovers over a thumbnail, the image should smoothly increase slightly.

### Part 2: Favorites

Add a favorites list on the right side of the app. The user now should be able to use a "favorites" button to add
the main dog image to their favorites.
When clicking on an item in the favorites list, that image and breed name should be shown as the main image.
There should be a button next to each favorited item for removing it from the favorites list.
